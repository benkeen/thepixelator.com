# thepixelator.com

This is the repo for the standalone, downloadable version of [thepixelator.com.](http://thepixelator.com).

Most of it (the interesting bits!) are in the javascript, but there's a few bits of PHP here and there which may be of use to someone.
The google shortener key in /code/get_short_url.php has been removed, as has the Google Analytics code. Other than that, it's a carbon copy
of the public site.

## Versions

### 1.0.0
The version currently running on the public site. This version is tagged (click on "tags"!)

### 1.1.0 (trunk)
A few more experiments I'm trying out. I was originally hoping to add in a "animate" option that would slowly change the sliders
at random speeds, however Canvas proved to be just too slow - I think I'll need to wait for WebGL for that. :)

This version also contains updates to all the various libraries etc. as well as having a new option to show the original picture.

The complete source code to thepixelator.com. Most of it (the interesting bits!) are in the javascript, but there's a few bit's of PHP here and there which may be of use to someone. The google shortener key in /code/get_short_url.php has been removed, as has the Google Analytics code. Other than that, it's a carbon copy of the current site.
